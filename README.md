Instructions:

Usign Visual Studio Code

Extensions:

	* C#
	* C# Dev Kit
	* .NET Core Test Explorer (to run unit tests)
	* vscode-solution-explorer (optional)

Main program in ConsoleApp1 project
	Call program using cmd: ConsoleApp1.exe [AbsoluteFilePath]

Unit tests in ConsoleApp1Tests project (NUnit)
	UnitTests.cs tests a couble of files and scenarios

I added a max filesize of 10MB just for not needing such a big file for testing.
This can easily by changed in FileUtil.cs if you want to test a bigger file.
